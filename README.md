🌿 To-Do List Web App

A modern, visually appealing To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on creating an engaging user experience with smooth animations, interactive components, and a refreshing natural theme.

A delete icon allows users to instantly remove tasks from the list.

🔊 Nature Background Sound

A looping nature sound plays only after the user’s first interaction, following browser autoplay restrictions.
